## **3 Features about this project**

 **1. Search Functionality**: This project includes a search functionality that allows users to search for specific items or content. Users can enter `keywords`, and the application filters and displays relevant results based on their search queries. This feature enhances user experience by helping them find information quickly and efficiently.

 **2. Donation Statistics Visualization**: This project includes a feature for visualizing donation statistics using a `pie chart`. It calculates and displays `two key pieces` of information: the total number of donations and the user's individual donations. The pie chart provides a visual representation of these statistics, making it easier for users to understand and interpret the data. This feature can be valuable for organizations and individuals to track and showcase their charitable contributions and fundraising progress.

 **3. Responsive UI**: The application appears to have a responsive user interface that adjusts its layout and content based on the `user's` device screen size. A responsive design is a crucial feature, as it ensures that the application is accessible and user-friendly on various devices, including `desktops`, `tablets`, and `mobile phones`, providing a consistent experience across platforms.

**This project visually represents `donation statistics` with a `pie chart`, `showcasing total donations` and `individual contributions`. It simplifies data interpretation, aiding organizations and individuals in tracking and showcasing their charitable impact and fundraising progress.**
